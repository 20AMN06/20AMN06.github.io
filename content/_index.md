I am currently pursuing a **Dual Degree (M.Sc. Physics + B.E. Chemical Engineering)** at [BITS Pilani - Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), and I am in my second year. My academic focus is centered on **research-oriented physics**, with particular interest in areas such as **quantum mechanics**.
<br/>
My primary engagement is academic, directed toward building a strong theoretical foundation and research capability in physics alongside engineering training.
