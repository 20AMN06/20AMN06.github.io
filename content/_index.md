I am currently pursuing a **Dual Degree (M.Sc. Physics + B.E. Chemical Engineering)** at **BITS Pilani – Pilani Campus**, and I am in my second year. My academic focus is centered on **research-oriented physics**, with particular interest in areas such as **quantum mechanics**.

My primary engagement is academic, directed toward building a strong theoretical foundation and research capability in physics alongside engineering training.
